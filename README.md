## HackList
This project demonstrates the usage of MVP pattern along with RxJava/Android and the Dagger 2 dependecy injection framework.

HackList uses [HackalistAPI](http://www.hackalist.org/) to retrieve details about upcoming hackathons including filtering and search options. 

Inspired by:
[Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
